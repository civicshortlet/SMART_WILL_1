;; ===================================================================
;; SMART WILL CONTRACT FOR STACKS BLOCKCHAIN
;; ===================================================================
;; A professional smart contract that allows will creators to distribute
;; assets to beneficiaries based on block height conditions with full
;; control over the will lifecycle.
;;
;; Features:
;; - Multi-beneficiary support with individual allocations
;; - Block height-based release conditions
;; - Comprehensive security checks and validations
;; - Event logging for all major actions
;; - Owner controls: update, cancel before release
;; - Beneficiary claiming after release condition
